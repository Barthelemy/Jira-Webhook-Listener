Jira Webhook Listener
=========================

A small set of scripts to capture JIRA Webhook events and run custom actions (such as sending a notification email to a non JIRA user, or running a command to refresh a HTML mirror of the project)

This project has been forked and is used as base for another setup. As a consequence a number of changes have been made.
