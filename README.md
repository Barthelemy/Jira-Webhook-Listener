Jira Webhook Listener
=========================

A small set of scripts to capture JIRA Webhook events and run custom actions (such as sending a notification email to a non JIRA user, or running a command to refresh a HTML mirror of the project)

This project was created to service a very specific need, though hopefully it might prove a useful base for others.



Issue Tracking
-----------------

Issues are tracked within a private JIRA install, however a HTML mirror can be viewed at http://projects.bentasker.co.uk/jira_projects/browse/JWL.html
